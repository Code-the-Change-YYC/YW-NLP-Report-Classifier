# Short MongoDB Assignment

This is an assignment to help get you familiarized with MongoDB, pymongo, and our Git and Jira workflow. Instructions:

1. Make a new **user** branch using the naming convention found in [this document](https://github.com/Code-the-Change-YYC/Development-Resources/blob/master/Git-Guide/Branching-Conventions.adoc).
2. In this branch, create a new folder called `assignment1`.
3. In this folder, create a new Python file called `assignment1.py`.
4. In this file, write a script that finds a document from your local MongoDB instance and writes it's contents to the console.
5. Create a pull request of your branch in GitHub.

You can look at my implementation if you need hints in this folder.
